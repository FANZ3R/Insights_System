      "observation": "Current period spend dropped 21.36% versus the prior period (25.55\u202fM vs 32.50\u202fM) and is 61% below the industry average spend of 65.90\u202fM for a comparable period.",
      "recommendation": "Conduct a root\u2011cause analysis of the spend decline, review demand forecasts, and renegotiate contracts or explore alternative suppliers to recover lost volume while protecting margins.",
