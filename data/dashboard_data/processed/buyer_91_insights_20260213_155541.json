      "title": "Supplier count far above industry norm",
      "observation": "You sourced from 10 distinct suppliers, 170% more than the industry average of 3.7 suppliers per period. This expands management overhead and increases coordination risk.",
      "recommendation": "Implement a supplier rationalization program: qualify additional strategic vendors, but also set clear criteria to prune low\u2011value suppliers and streamline procurement processes.",

      "observation": "9 out of your 10 active suppliers (90%) are new in the current period, indicating a very high churn rate compared with typical buyer stability.",
      "recommendation": "Introduce a formal supplier onboarding and performance\u2011tracking framework to retain high\u2011performing partners and reduce unnecessary turnover.",

      "observation": "Cryosurgery equipment or accessories represent 47% of your total spend ($27.46\u202fM of $58.05\u202fM). Such concentration can expose you to price volatility and supply risk.",
      "recommendation": "Conduct a category\u2011wide spend analysis, explore alternative suppliers or substitute products, and negotiate multi\u2011year contracts to mitigate risk.",
